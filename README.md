Voltmeter is the instrument used to measure the potential difference (voltage) between any two points of the circuit. Voltmeter is connected in parallel between two points whose potential difference is to be measured. Since the resistance of the voltmeter is very high, the current passing through it is also very small. Thus, almost all of the current is ensured to pass through the circuit part whose potential difference is to be measured. The potential difference is represented by the symbol "V" and its unit is the volt. Voltmeters have analog and digital display types. The reverse of the ammeter is connected in parallel, if it is connected in series, no current flows through the circuit and an open circuit situation occurs...
